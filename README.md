>Problem Statement     :    

In today's world, mental health issues are gaining widespread global attention due to their extensive and often imperceptible impacts. Numerous studies have highlighted that poor mental health can profoundly affect an individual's overall quality of life, encompassing both personal and professional domains.

Discussing the importance of recognizing whether someone needs mental health care becomes crucial because it can help prevent various more serious problems, such as suicide or crime. Suicide and crime resulting from mental health disorders are alarming phenomena __[source](https://www.jawapos.com/kesehatan/01423686/kriminalitas-kerap-dipicu-masalah-kesehatan-mental-ini-kata-psikiater)__. Proper data and analysis can help identify risk factors and warning signs that may arise, enabling timely intervention measures to be taken.

>Objective          :

The primary objective of this project is to develop a classification model aimed at predicting care options based on the provided dataset. The methodology involves constructing classification models utilizing five distinct algorithms: K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Support Vector Classifier (SVC), Random Forest, AdaBoost, and Decision Tree. Evaluation of these models will be conducted using the recall metric to ascertain the most effective model, subsequently facilitating its deployment for predictive purposes.
